# 🔐 Privacy Policy - ChatAnon

## Your Privacy Matters

We take your privacy seriously. This document explains exactly what happens to your messages and data.

## 💬 Message Privacy

### ✅ **What We DON'T Do:**
- **No message storage**: Messages are never saved to any database
- **No chat history**: Conversations are not logged or recorded
- **No message persistence**: When you disconnect, all messages are permanently deleted
- **No data collection**: We don't collect personal information beyond your chosen display name

### 🔄 **How Messages Work:**
1. **You type a message** → Sent to server in real-time
2. **Server forwards message** → Delivered to your chat partner instantly
3. **Message exists only in memory** → Never written to disk
4. **When chat ends** → Message is immediately deleted from server memory

## 🛡️ **Security Measures**

### **Current Protection:**
- **No permanent storage**: Messages exist only during active conversations
- **Memory-only processing**: Server handles messages in RAM, never saves to disk
- **Automatic cleanup**: All user data is cleared when connections end
- **No logging**: Message content is not written to server logs

### **Enhanced Protection Available:**
We've developed an **end-to-end encryption version** where:
- Messages are encrypted on your device before sending
- Server only sees encrypted gibberish
- Even the server admin cannot read your messages
- Only you and your chat partner can decrypt messages

## 👨‍💻 **Server Admin Access**

### **What's Technically Possible:**
- **Real-time monitoring**: Server admin could theoretically view messages as they pass through
- **Log modification**: Server could be modified to save messages (but currently doesn't)
- **Memory inspection**: Advanced techniques could potentially access server memory

### **What We Actually Do:**
- **No monitoring**: We don't watch or read conversations
- **No logging**: Messages are not saved to any logs
- **No data retention**: Everything is deleted when chats end
- **No analytics**: We don't track message content or patterns

## 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption (Optional)**

For maximum privacy, we offer an encrypted version:

### **How It Works:**
1. **Key generation**: Each user generates encryption keys locally
2. **Key exchange**: Users exchange public keys (not private keys)
3. **Message encryption**: Messages are encrypted on your device
4. **Server relay**: Server only sees encrypted data
5. **Message decryption**: Only your chat partner can decrypt messages

### **Benefits:**
- **Zero server access**: Even we can't read your messages
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Each conversation uses unique keys
- **No key storage**: Encryption keys are never saved anywhere

## 📊 **Data We Do Collect**

### **Minimal Data Collection:**
- **Display name**: Only what you choose to share (not linked to identity)
- **Connection count**: Anonymous statistics for server capacity
- **Basic analytics**: Number of users, connections (no personal data)

### **What We Don't Collect:**
- **Real names or identities**
- **IP addresses** (beyond basic connection requirements)
- **Location data**
- **Device information**
- **Browsing history**
- **Personal information**

## 🌐 **Third-Party Services**

### **Hosting:**
- **Render.com**: Our hosting provider may have access to server logs
- **Standard hosting logs**: May include IP addresses and access times
- **No message content**: Hosting provider cannot see message content

### **CDN Services:**

- **No analytics**: We don't use Google Analytics or similar services
- **No social media**: No Facebook, Twitter, or other social tracking

## 🔒 **Your Rights**

### **Data Control:**
- **Disconnect anytime**: Your data is immediately deleted
- **No account needed**: No registration or personal information required
- **Anonymous usage**: No way to trace conversations back to you

### **Transparency:**

- **Regular updates**: Privacy policy updated with any changes
